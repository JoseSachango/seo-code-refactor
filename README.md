## Motivation

```
As a developer I've been hired by a marketing agency to refactor a codebase. 
This codebase should accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. The HTML and CSS documents contained in this repository are my attempts at doing so.
```

## Acceptance criteria are as follows:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```


### Take aways:

* When working with tags that have the same style properties it's a good idea to give them all a similiar class attribute. This makes  using the CSS selectors more convenient.
